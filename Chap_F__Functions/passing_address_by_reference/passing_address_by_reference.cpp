	would cause the error of re-assigning a const-ptr:
	" 'p': you cannot assign to a variable that is const. "
	
	which is the same behavior of a const-ref to the pointer.
	
	and if the signature is changed to (int* &p), the *p_x in the main, 
	when changeContent returns, is an undefined behavior, because p_x will point
	to the address in memory originally allocated to 'y', 
	but that memory does not contain 17 anymore because it has been freed 
	when y goes out of scope at the end of changeContent.
